Brittle is a JavaScript library that allows you to generate documents from templates. Similar to ejs, Brittle enables you to dynamically insert content into your templates using JavaScript code.

## Installation

You can install Brittle using npm:

```shell
npm install brittle-templates
```

## Usage

To use Brittle, you need to import the library and utilize the `runTemplate` function. Here's an example of generating a document using a template:

Sample code:
```js
import fs from "fs";
import runTemplate from "brittle-templates";

const source = fs.readFileSync("input.md", "utf-8");
const output = runTemplate(source);
fs.writeFileSync("output.md", output, "utf-8");
```

`input.md`:
```md
# Sample Document

The following list will be autogenerated:

[`let randomValue`]
[`for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {`]
[`randomValue = Math.random();`]
[=`i`]. The resulting random value was [=`randomValue`].
[`}`]
```

`output.md` (generated file):
```md
# Sample Document

The following list will be autogenerated:

1. The resulting random value was 0.20118583281078317.
2. The resulting random value was 0.06210908536648563.
3. The resulting random value was 0.6070385756910699.
4. The resulting random value was 0.045630886770123835.
5. The resulting random value was 0.5679299839157612.
```

In the example above, the template consists of JavaScript code enclosed within backticks (\`). The code is denoted by the brackets [] and executed during the template rendering. In this case, the code initializes a variable `randomValue` and generates random values within a loop.

The resulting document will be returned as a string by the `runTemplate` function.
